Bricks is a collection of useful C++ code, organised in standalone header
files. By default, the code uses the latest stable C++ standard (C++17 as of
2019).

Of course, you can check "upstream" for updates and pull them into your copies
at your leisure. I have tried to minimise dependencies, but some bricks
inevitably use other bricks (all relevant #includes are near the top of each
file).
